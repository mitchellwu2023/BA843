Executive Summary
Analyzing flight data provides essential insights into the operational dynamics of the aviation industry, aiding stakeholders in optimizing resources, enhancing efficiency, and improving customer experience. Our primary objective was to explore and analyze factors contributing to flight delays or cancellations, identifying trends for airlines and airports while delving into timing and seasonality. This report offers a macro-level understanding of key domains, focusing on airlines, airports, and timing to uncover areas for improvement and provide valuable insights into the root causes of flight disruptions. Our project offers a comprehensive analysis of flight data spanning from 2018 to 2022, employing both traditional analytical methods and machine learning (ML) techniques to uncover insights into flight delays and cancellations. Our analysis revealed significant insights across various dimensions of flight operations. Regional airlines and airports, notably Dallas Fort-Worth Airport, experienced higher rates of delays and cancellations. Certain regions in the eastern USA, including Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth, and Denver International Airport, emerged as hotspots for flight cancellations. Larger carriers such as Southwest, American, Delta, and United demonstrated superior performance in managing flight operations compared to smaller airlines. Evening and night hours, along with winter and early spring months, saw increased delays and cancellations, often due to adverse weather conditions. External factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 and extreme weather events, significantly impacted flight cancellations. These findings provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities within the aviation industry, guiding strategies for operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction. By integrating machine learning, we've developed predictive models to forecast flight delays, empowering travelers with proactive planning tools. Though initial iterations weren't flawless, logistic regression emerged as the most effective model, highlighting specific airports and morning flights as key predictors for delays. Continuous refinement of our models aims to enhance accuracy and provide superior insights. In conclusion, our blend of traditional analysis and ML techniques allows for a deeper understanding and resolution of flight disruptions' root causes. Leveraging these insights, airlines can optimize operational efficiency, mitigate disruptions, and ensure smoother travel experiences for passengers. With ML pushing boundaries, the future of air travel holds promise for enhanced reliability and convenience for all travelers.

Motivation
Flight delays are more than just inconveniences; they disrupt plans, cause stress, and incur economic losses. Our project is driven by a shared empathy for the frustrations passengers face and a commitment to alleviating them. By analyzing data on flight delays and cancellations, we aim to uncover patterns unique to airlines and airports, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and improving the overall travel experience. Our goal is not only to minimize disruptions but also to offer proactive solutions that mitigate their economic impact, ensuring smoother journeys for all travelers.

Project Proposal
Our project aims to utilize a comprehensive dataset containing flight delay and cancellation information from US commercial airlines to address several critical objectives. Firstly, we will conduct an in-depth analysis of delays over time, examining specific patterns related to airlines or airports. By analyzing historical data, we intend to uncover recurring trends and seasonal variations, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing flight schedules and punctuality.
Secondly, we will delve into the root causes of flight delays, identifying primary factors contributing to disruptions and assessing how these trends evolve over time. Through meticulous examination and advanced analytics techniques, we seek to gain insights into the leading reasons for delays, including inclement weather, air traffic congestion, mechanical issues, and crew scheduling constraints.
Lastly, we aim to develop predictive models capable of forecasting future flight cancellations or delays, along with estimating the approximate duration of these disruptions. Leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms, our goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for proactive planning and risk mitigation strategies. Additionally, we intend to offer passengers optimal travel time recommendations based on our analysis, enabling them to make informed decisions and minimize the impact of disruptions on their travel plans.
In summary, our project endeavors to harness data-driven insights to enhance operational efficiency, improve passenger experience, and mitigate economic losses associated with flight disruptions. By comprehensively analyzing flight delay and cancellation data, we aim to provide valuable insights and recommendations that benefit both airlines and passengers, ultimately contributing to smoother and more reliable air travel experiences.
